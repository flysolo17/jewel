        waste management program to ensure the protection of public health and the environment.
        It mandates the bureau to provide secretariat support to the National Solid Waste Management
        Commission in the implementation of the solid waste management plans and prescribes policies
        to achieve the objectives of the National Ecology Center that is in charge of information dissemination,
        consultation, education and training of various local government units on ecological waste management.
        The ecological solid waste management program is expected to assist Local Government Units in implementing RA 9003
        or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act particularly in the development of their 10 yr. SWM Plan, closure and
        rehabilitation of dumpsites, establishment of Materials Recovery Facilities, and an environmentally sound disposal system.
        Under R.A. 9003, violation of said provision is punishable with imprisonment from one day to three years, or fines from P300 to
        as much as P500,000. With such stiff penalties, the DENR chief believes that collectors will be encouraged to implement ecological
        waste management and dispose of their collected garbage properly. â€œAt the same time, this will also compel those who still do not
        segregate their own wastes to do so</string>
